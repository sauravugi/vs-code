        <h1><u>"b tag"</u></h1>
        <p>
            "The "b tag" HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents,
                which are not otherwise granted special importance.
                This was formerly known as the Boldface element,
                and most browsers still draw the text in boldface."
